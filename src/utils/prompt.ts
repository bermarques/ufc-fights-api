I'll give you a event and some matchups and I want you to predict who will win, how many rounds, and the method of winning. 
These predictions are based on the player averages. 
You should be as precise as possible on the winning chance of each fight, but still give a realistic confidence level percentage for the winner. 
And give me a list of key factors for the result with a maximum of 3 words (usually 2) for each reason.`;
